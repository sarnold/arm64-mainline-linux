Subject: [PATCH 172/173] dt-bindings: HID: i2c-hid: Document reset-related
 properties

Some I2C HID devices has a reset pin and requires that some specified
time elapses after this reset pin is deasserted, before communication
with the device is attempted.

The Linux implementation is looking for these in the "reset-gpios" and
"post-reset-deassert-delay-ms" properties already, so use these property
names.
